        ABOUT
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hi my name is David Lee. I studied Digital Media at the NYU Tandon
        School of Engineering. What is digital media you may ask? It’s a broad
        range of things including 3d, game design, programming, photography and
        other bits and bobs. Once out of school I gravitated towards 3d roles,
        regardless of how limited the 3d role was or it’s intended purpose. It
        gave me exposure to many things and different fields. As a freelancer
        you are required to continue learning, stay up to date, learn new
        programs, and fast. Somewhere along the way I realized I enjoy learning.
        And I started branching out. I attended graphic designing school part
        time and worked at a small design studio; I got to try a lot of new
        things as well as learn a lot at the same time. Currently, I’m
        continuing my learning endeavor with Front End Web. My passion for
        learning has given me a multi- faceted skill set with varied experience.
        I will continue to hone my skill set, and learn while sharing my
        knowledge with others.
